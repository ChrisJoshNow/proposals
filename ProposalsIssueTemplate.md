# Proposals Issue Template

TBD

This doc will hold guidelines for new proposal Issues as well as a cut-and-paste template to improve the quality of Issues. 

## Guidelines for filing a good issue
To ensure that your proposal receives the attention it deserves, there are some basic guidelines you should follow:

  - Do a quick [search](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for your proposal before posting, and if there's an open conversation please join it instead.
  - Give your issue a descriptive title. "VR idea" will likely get ignored and closed. "Better VR video" is slightly more descriptive, but still very ambiguous. "Proposal for handling protected video content" is a far more informative title.
  - Your proposal should suggest a direction for addressing the issue. Stating "I think WebXR content should be faster." isn't particularly helpful, while "Technology X is now available, which can improve render times. It could potentially be exposed to WebXR like this..." is a much more effective starting point for a conversation. However, please be open to alternative approaches and healthy discussion. (See [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).)
  - Describing real world use cases for your proposal is always plus! What would it enable that couldn't be done before, or improve over what can be done today?
