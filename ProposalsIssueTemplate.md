# Proposals Issue Template

## Guidelines for filing a good issue
To ensure that your proposal receives the attention it deserves, there are some basic guidelines you should follow:

Search in [proposals](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and [webxr]() for your proposal topic. If there's an open conversation please join it instead.

Give your issue a descriptive title. "VR idea" will likely get ignored and closed. "Better video" is slightly more descriptive, but still very ambiguous. "Proposal for handling protected video content" is a far more informative title.

Your proposal should suggest a direction for addressing the issue. Stating "I think WebXR content should be faster." isn't particularly helpful, while "Technology X is now available, which can improve render times. It could potentially be exposed to WebXR like this..." is a much more effective starting point for a conversation. However, please be open to alternative approaches and healthy discussion. (See [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).)

Describing real world use cases for your proposal is always plus! What would it enable that couldn't be done before, or improve over what can be done today?

## Template

### Title

Just enough information to be specific and memorable.

### Summary

One or two paragraphs listing the problem being solved and the target audience for the idea.

### Example use cases

Two or three examples of an end user with goals and a step-by-step description of how the proposed idea solves helps them achieve the goal.

### A rough idea or two about implementation

One or two paragraphs about how the feature might be implemented, mostly to help clarify how you're thinking about the problem space and the underlying technologies that could solve the problems.
