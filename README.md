# Immersive Web Community Group Ideas Repo

## What is this repo for?
This repo serves as an incubator for early ideas on additions, improvements, and discussion of Immersive Web functionality.

## I have an idea! How do I get started?
To get the ball rolling with an idea file an issue on this repo. That issue will host discussion of the idea until such time that it's either given it's own repo or closed as will not implement.

## Do I have to have a spec/explainer/proof of concept before posting an idea?
No! Certainly if you have any of those available it's great to share them, but it's absolutely not necessary. At minimum you should have a clear goal in mind and a propsed direction for how to address it.

## Guidelines for filing a good issue
To ensure that your idea receives the attention is deserves, there's some basic guidelines you should follow:

  - Do a quick search for your idea before posting, and if there's an open conversation please join it instead.
  - Give your issue a descriptive title. "VR idea" will likely get ignored and closed. "Better VR video" is slightly more descriptive, but still very ambiguous. "Efficent video playback via XRLayers" is great.
  - Your idea should propose a direction for addressing the issue. Stating "I think WebXR content should be faster." isn't particularly helpful, while "Technology X is now available, which can improve render times. It could potentially be exposed to WebXR like this..." is a much more effective starting point for a conversation.
  - Describing realistic use cases for your idea is always a positive!

## Lifetime of an idea
The exact path any given idea takes is highly dependent on the context and scope of the idea itself, but in general you should expect a successful idea to do the following:

  - Propose an idea in the issues tracker on this repository.
  - Gather support from other contributors, including ideally at least one or two browser vendors.
  - Ideas with enough support and a clear technical direction can request a repository be created under the immersive-web organization. (Alternatively an external repository can be transferred to the immersive-web organization.) The repo will be flagged as being in incubation.
  - Development of the idea will continue on the repository until it's ready to be promoted out of incubation state.
  - At that point the idea's repo will either have the incubation flag removed or be merged into another repo as appropriate.

## Code of Conduct
